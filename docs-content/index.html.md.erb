This documentation describes the Splunk Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Firehose. 
Splunk Nozzle integrates with PCF [Loggregator](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/loggregator/index.html) 
and forwards streaming logs and metrics from user apps and system components of Cloud Foundry to Splunk Enterprise.
PCF operators can then gain operational visibility over their PCF infrastructure, including the health and performance of their
apps and system components.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF Tile streams logs and metrics from PCF and forwards them
to user-specified Splunk Enterprise indexers configured to receive data via [HTTP Event Collector](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/6.6.1/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).
PCF operators and Splunk users can immediately search and analyze PCF Firehose data from their
Splunk Enterprise deployment to build reports, dashboards, and alerts on the health
and performance of their apps.

Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF includes the following key features:

* Setup with out-of-the-box data parsing and enrichment for various PCF event types.
* Reliable event delivery by leveraging Splunk's HTTP Event Collector endpoint.
* Secure forwarding from PCF into external Splunk environments using user-provided SSL certificates.
* Scales out to meet increasing data volume and number of apps.
